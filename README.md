## Description

- This is a node application which uses the express package to render dynamically generated Team Profile populated with user data extracted from prompts enabled by express package. 

- The application runs in the command line. When the user initiates the application using npm start or node index.js, they are then prompted with a series of questions. The user's answers are then 
put into a template and a webpage is dynamically created with the inputted user data. 

- The dynamically generated webpage includes links to email which will open up the user's default email application
and populate the send line of the email with the team member's email address and also populate the subject line. 

- This functionality is also afforded for an engineer's github profile as if you click on the user name it will automatically open the selected engineer's github profile in a new tab in the user's web browser.
